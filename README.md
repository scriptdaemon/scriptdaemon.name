## Description

The minimalist(-ish) webpage to which this repository is associated is my own
personal space on the web and should thus need no introduction.

This document only serves to appease GitHub and will likely remain bare.
However, if I decide to implement something particularly clever, I may describe
my methods here for those interested.
